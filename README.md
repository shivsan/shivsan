<h3 align="center">A curious developer, having over 10 years of professional experience. My primary goals are in building business applications and learning how to make them better and faster. I have a wide variety of interests: system design, newer paradigms of architecture, improving quality in code and design, building cloud native applications etc.
 
I have worked across different technologies and frameworks. A firm believer of TDD and other practices of XP. Interested to explore better architectural approaches like DDD, event driven development and platforms/technologies like AWS, Kafka, spark etc.</h3>
